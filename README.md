## How it's coordinated

It all starts with the selection of the difficulty by the user in **demande_user_gmode.c**, presenting two options which are EASY and HARD.  

Then the program proceeds to ask the user for a specific color code input in the range of 4 letters with the given 6 color codes that are **R** for <span style="color:red;">Red</span>, C for Cyan, Y for yellow, G for Green, B for Blue and P for Pink.  

<span style="color:red;">This text will be red</span>

<span style="color:blue;">This text will be blue</span>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">This text will be red using hexadecimal color code</span>
